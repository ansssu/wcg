# wcg

Because counting words shouldn't be boring!

## What is this?

Welcome to **wcg**! This is the cooler, younger sibling of the good ol' `wc` command. It's like the `wc` command, but with more pizzazz and just as much sass. 🕺

## Features

- 🚀 **Fast**: Because who has time to wait?
- 🤓 **Accurate**: Counts words, lines, and characters like a pro.
- 🐱‍🏍 **Cool**: Makes word counting feel like an adventure.

## Installation

To get **wcg** up and running on your machine, follow these super simple steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wcg.git
cd wcg
make install
Usage
Using wcg is as easy as pie 🍰. Just run:

sh
wcg [options] [file...]
Options:
-w : Count the words. Because words matter.

-l : Count the lines. The more, the merrier.

-c : Count the characters. Size does matter.

-h : Help. Because everyone needs a little help sometimes.

Examples
Count all the things:

sh
wcg -wlc myfile.txt
Get just the words (because you're a minimalist):

sh
wcg -w myfile.txt
